Let's get you set up! Hush Line works best as a background serviceâ€”once configured, we'll deliver messages to your inbox so you never have to log back in.

## Step 1. Create a Hush Line Account

Hush Line does not require personally identifiable information (PII) to register a tip line. For extra privacy, use our [Onion service](https://www.torproject.org/download/).

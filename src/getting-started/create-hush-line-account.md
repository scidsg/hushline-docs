## Best Practices For Your Password

- Use a "passphrase" for your password. For example, instead of using a password like `3p3mSq7T%Hr2dZ^rDTuW`, use random words you can easily remember mixed with special characters and a number like `Freestyle-Liqueur-Survival2`.
- Do not reuse passwords from other sites.
- Consider using a password manager to store your account credentials.

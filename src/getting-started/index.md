# Getting Started with Hush Line

Hush Line is intended to be a background service for you - add your key, then forward your messages to your desired email address, and never have to worry about logging back into the Hush Line platform again. We recommend usingÂ [Proton Mail](https://proton.me) since we're built on the same encryption technology - PGP or [Pretty Good Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy). PGP is an open protocol providing strong encryption that's been around for decades and is trusted by governments and activists alike. When you use Proton Mail as described below, your anonymous Hush Line messages will be automatically delivered to and decrypted in your Inbox - no logging back into the Hush Line platform necessary. And since your messages are encrypted with a key to which only you have access, they are unreadable to anyone but you ðŸ’ª.

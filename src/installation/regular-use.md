# Regular use

Now you're ready for day-to-day Hush Line use. 

## How to leave your Raspberry Pi

For your Hush Line to work, all you need to do is keep your Raspberry Pi powered and connected to the internet (you don't need to have a monitor or keyboard plugged into it all the time.) Hush Line will run 24/7, and even keep itself updated automatically.

## Promoting your Hush Line

Now we need to get some messages from your community.

To do this, share/publicize your Hush Line site URL to your community. Be sure to include a link to [download and install Tor Browser](https://torproject.org/download), which they'll need to access your Hush Line site. You can share this information via email, your work chat app, on social media platforms, fliers, and even business cards if appropriate.

After that, all you need to do is monitor your Hush Line email address's inbox, using the computer you set up Mailvelope on. When attempting to read a Hush Line message, you may be periodically be prompted to enter your PGP password again. 

Again, only people using this computer, who know your PGP password, will be able you read your Hush Line messages.
